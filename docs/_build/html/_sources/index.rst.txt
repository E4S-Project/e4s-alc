E4S-alc (Ã€-la-carte) is a practical software tool designed to simplify the creation of Dockerfiles and Singularityfiles with relevant Spack configurations. Our tool focuses on making the set up of Spack package-loaded containers faster and easier, allowing developers to focus more on their coding and less on system configurations.
