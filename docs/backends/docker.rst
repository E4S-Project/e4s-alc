Docker
=====

The Docker backend is currently supported through this `python package <https://pypi.org/project/docker/>`_.

Description
------

All utilities of **E4S A-La-Carte** for the Docker backend use the local docker daemon. This means that the local docker installation and **e4s-alc** access the same images, and all **e4s-alc** commands ultimately will be run by the local docker daemon.
